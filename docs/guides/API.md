**https://jsonapi.org/**

## Pagination:
  - by cursor (aka "absolute pagination")
  - cursor responsability: identify element of a collection, THAT'S IT! No filtering, no page size, etc.

Note: In a scenario where we nest like A -> B -> C, there is NO dependency from C on A !
  -> This matters for cursor pagination links in a relationship scenario

## JSON-api relationships
- Relationships links should be aliases on the resource when the relation IS a resource
- When it is an attribute (1 to 1 scenario) treat the suppresion of the relationship like an attribute update

## Notes:

- Every resource should be exposed as a top level endpoint (meaning: only one ID needs to be known to make a request).
Nesting is allowed but is purely an alias.

- POST for UPSERT

- GraphQL could be a valid alternative, but I think they lost conceptually. Would not try to discourage someone from using it, but Iâ€™m 90% sure JSON-api is a better choice :)
