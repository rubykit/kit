- Admin (especially the MULTI ADMIN scenario)

- Errors hash: establish format, probably like:
  [:error, errors: [{ attr: :email, msg: "is already taken" }], { msg: "Incorrect password or non existing user"}]]

- Forms helpers (as it relates to errors)

- API / JSON-api


- Figure out how to use kit-auth engine view path for doorkeeper engine

- Add IP / User agent to tokens

- Event store?


- Views: auto add class that matches the name of the cell? If so, on which element?
