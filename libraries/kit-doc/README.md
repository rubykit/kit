# Kit::Doc

[Kit::Doc] is a tool to generate documentation for your Ruby projects.

- To see a live example of the generated docs, see [Kit::Doc's own documentation](https://docs.rubykit.org/kit-doc/edge).
- To learn how to use Kit::Doc in your projects, see the [Usage](docs/guides/usage.md) guide.
- To learn how to document your projects, see the [Writing documentation](docs/guides/writing_documentation.md) guide.

## Acknowledgements

[Kit::Doc] uses:
- [Yard] to generate the Ruby documentation
- [ExDoc] for the static assets

At the core [Kit::Doc] it is a [Yard] plugin with a heavily modified template that generates [ExDoc] compatible html assets.

The guides also heavily reuse [ExDoc's guides](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_doc/readme.html) & [Elixir's guides](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/writing-documentation.html) content.

## Features

  * Automatically generates HTML documentation from your API documentation
  * Accessible online and offline (no server-side dependencies)
  * Generate reproducible documentation for each of all known versions
  * Support for custom pages and guides (in addition to the API reference)

On the front-end, thanks to [ExDoc assets]:
  * Support for custom grouping of module and pages in the sidebar
  * Responsive design with built-in layout for phones and tablets
  * A version dropdown to quickly switch to other versions
  * Customizable logo on the generated documentation
  * Each documented entry contains a direct link back to the source code
  * Full-text client-side search
  * Keyboard shortcuts (press `?` inside an existing documentation to bring the help dialog)
  * Quick search with autocompletion support (`s` keyboard shortcut)
  * Support for night-mode (automatically detected according to the browser preferences)
