# Kit::Dotenv

`Kit::Dotenv` provides some overloads to `Dotenv` to account for engines & dummy apps (multiple root directories).

## TODO

Rethink "environments": we probably need something that is not uni-dimensional.
Like a general "type" of env ("test") but then different groups, for DBs, external services, etc. Think: local test env VS CI test env for instance.
